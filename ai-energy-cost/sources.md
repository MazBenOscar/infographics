## Methodology Notes

### Energy Consumption Calculations
- **Large AI Model:** 100B+ parameters, training run duration ~1-3 months
- **Estimated Consumption:** ~1,200 MWh per large training run
- **US Household Average:** ~12 MWh per year (EIA data)
- **Equivalence:** ~100 households per training run

### CO₂ Equivalent
- **Calculation:** ~550 tons CO₂ per training run (US grid average ~0.85 lbs CO₂/kWh)
- **Note:** Varies significantly by data center location and grid composition

### Growth Metrics
- **AI Compute Growth:** 15× since 2018 (based on training FLOPs of flagship models)
- **Data Center Demand:** +160% projected growth
- **Renewable Additions:** +45% capacity growth

## Data Quality & Limitations

- Training energy varies by model architecture, efficiency optimizations, and hardware
- Data center PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) ranges from 1.1 (best) to 1.6 (typical)
- Renewable gap analysis based on global averages; regional variations exist
- 2025 projections based on Q4 2024/Q1 2025 market data
